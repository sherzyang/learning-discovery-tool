Some have a green rind on the outside and a red-pink flesh on the inside, with brown seeds. Some can have yellow flesh, and some can be seedless. The green rind on the outside is not usually eaten, though it can be used as a vegetable. It can also be stewed or pickled. Most watermelons are oblong or spherical. In Japan, watermelons are grown in different shapes. Many people like to eat watermelon in the summer because the fruit is cool and refreshing. Watermelons are a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6 and vitamin B1. They also contain potassium, magnesium, carotenoid antioxidant, and lycopene. Watermelons are fruits that come from a vine-like plant.\""

       " 'In mathematics, global analysis, also called analysis on manifolds, is the study of the global and topological properties of differential equations on manifolds and vector bundles.  Global analysis uses techniques in infinite-dimensional manifold theory and topological spaces of mappings to classify behaviors of differential equations, particularly nonlinear differential equations. These spaces can include singularities and hence catastrophe theory is a part of global analysis. Optimization problems, such as finding geodesics on Riemannian manifolds, can be solved using differential equations so that the calculus of variations overlaps with global analysis. Global analysis finds application in physics in the study of dynamical systems and topological quantum field theory.\\n\\nJournals\\nAnnals of Global Analysis and Geometry\\nThe Journal of Geometric Analysis\\n\\nSee also\\nAtiyah–Singer index theorem\\nGeometric analysis\\nLie groupoid\\nPseudogroup\\nMorse theory\\nStructural stability\\nHarmonic map\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\n\\nMathematics 241A: Introduction to Global Analysis',\n",

       " 'The \\'I\\' and the \\'me\\' are terms central to the social philosophy of George Herbert Mead, one of the key influences on the development of the branch of sociology called symbolic interactionism. The terms refer to the psychology of the individual, where in Mead\\'s understanding, the \"me\" is the socialized aspect of the person, and the \"I\" is the active aspect of the person.One might usefully \\'compare Mead\\'s \"I\" and \"me\", respectively, with Sartre\\'s \"choice\" and \"the situation\". But Mead himself matched up the \"me\" with Freud\\'s \"censor\", and the \"I\" with his \"ego\"; and this is psychologically apt.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nThe \"Me\" is what is learned in interaction with others and (more generally) with the environment: other people\\'s attitudes, once internalized in the self, constitute the Me. This includes both knowledge about that environment (including society), but also about who the person is: their sense of self. \"What the individual is for himself is not something that he invented. It is what his significant others have come to ...treat him as being.\" This is because people learn to see who they are (man or woman, old or young, etc.) by observing the responses of others themselves or their actions. If others respond to a person as (for instance) a woman, the person develops a sense of herself indeed as a woman.\\nAt the same time, \\'the \"Me\" disciplines the \"I\" by holding it back from breaking the law of the community\\'. It is thus very close to the way in a man Freud\\'s \\'ego-censor, the conscience...arose from the critical influence of his parents (conveyed to him by the medium of the voice), to whom were added, as time went on, those who trained and taught him and the innumerable and indefinable host of all the other people in his environment—his fellow-men—and public opinion\\'. It is \\'the attitude of the other in one\\'s own organism, as controlling the thing that he is going to do\\'.By contrast, \\'the \"I\" is the response of the individual to the attitude of the community\\'. The \"I\" acts creatively, though within the context of the me. Mead notes that \"It is only after we have acted that we know what we have done...what we have said.\" People, he argues, are not automatons; Mead states that \"the \"I\" reacts to the self which arises though the taking of the attitude of others.\" They do not blindly follow rules. They construct a response on the basis of what they have learned, the \"me\". Mead highlighted accordingly those values that attach particularly to the \"I\" rather than to the me, \"...which cannot be calculated and which involve a reconstruction of the society, and so of the \\'me\\' which belongs to that society.\" Taken together, the \"I\" and the \"me\" form the person or the self in Mead\\'s social philosophy. According to Mead, there would be no possibility of personality without both the \"I\" and the \"Me\".\\n\\nFusion\\nMead explored what he called \\'the fusion of the \"I\" and the \"me\" in the attitudes of religion, patriotism, and team work\\', noting what he called the \"peculiar sense of exaltation\" that belongs to them. He also considered that \\'the idea of the fusion of the \"I\" and the \"me\" gives a very adequate explanation of this exaltation...in the aesthetic experience\\'.In everyday life, however, \\'a complete fusion of the \"I\" and the \"me\" may not be a good thing...it is a dynamic sort of balance between the \"I\" and the \"me\" that is required\\'.\\n\\nConventionality\\nWhen there is a predominance of the \"me\" in the personality, \\'we speak of a person as a conventional individual; his ideas are exactly the same as those of his neighbours; he is hardly more than a \"me\" under the circumstances\\'—\"...the shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality...\" that is \"all persona, with its excessive concern for what people think.\" The alternative—and in many ways Mead\\'s ideal—was the person who has a definite personality, who replies to the organized attitude in a way that makes a significant difference. With such a person, the I is the most important phase of the experience.\\n\\nDissociation\\nMead recognised that it is normal for an individual to have \\'all sorts of selves answering to all sorts of different social reactions\\', but also that it was possible for \\'a tendency to break up the personality\\' to appear: \\'Two separate \"me\\'s\" and \"I\\'s\", two different selves, result...the phenomenon of dissociation of personality\\'.\\n\\nLiterary examples\\nWalt Whitman \\'marks off the impulsive \"I\", the natural, existential aspect of the self, from critical sanction. It is the cultured self, the \"me\", in Mead\\'s terms, that needs re-mediation\\'.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n\\n== References ==']"
