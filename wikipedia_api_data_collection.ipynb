Some have a green rind on the outside and a red-pink flesh on the inside, with brown seeds. Some can have yellow flesh, and some can be seedless. The green rind on the outside is not usually eaten, though it can be used as a vegetable. It can also be stewed or pickled. Most watermelons are oblong or spherical. In Japan, watermelons are grown in different shapes. Many people like to eat watermelon in the summer because the fruit is cool and refreshing. Watermelons are a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6 and vitamin B1. They also contain potassium, magnesium, carotenoid antioxidant, and lycopene. Watermelons are fruits that come from a vine-like plant.\""

       "'Social conservatism is the belief that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions. This can include moral issues. Social conservatism is generally skeptical of social change, and believes in maintaining the status quo concerning social issues such as family life, sexual relations, and patriotism.Social conservatism encompasses a range of what may be thought of as reactionary positions on social issues. It developed as a reaction to what was perceived as dangerous tendencies within the liberal movements toward political radicalism and a wholesale rejection of \"traditional values\". In North America, since the mid to late 20th century, social conservatism arose as a response to federal action on social issues—such as LGBT rights and abortion—which members perceived as a threat to conservative values. Social conservatives also value the influence of religion in the public square, thus supporting state Churches or accommodationism, while opposing secularism and state atheism.\\n\\nSocial conservatism and other ideological views\\nThere is no necessary link between social and fiscal conservatism; some social conservatives such as George W. Bush and Michael Gerson are otherwise apolitical, centrist or liberal on economic and fiscal issues. Social conservatives may sometimes support economic intervention where the intervention serves moral or cultural aims. Many social conservatives support a balance between fair trade and a free market. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional mores, will often have a basis in religion. Examples include the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, the Family First Party and Katter\\'s Australian Party, and the communitarian movement in the United States.\\nThere is more overlap between social conservatism and paleoconservatism, in that they both have respect for traditional social forms.The term social conservatism is not to be confused with an economically interventionist conservatism, where conservative ideas are combined with keynesian economics and a welfare state, which is practised by some european conservatives, e.g. One-nation conservatism in Britain or Gaullism in France.\\n\\nSocial conservatism in different countries\\nIslamic world\\nMost Muslim countries are socially and morally conservative (such as Sudan, Malaysia and Gambia) due to their interpretation of Islamic law also known as Shariah.\\nArab world\\n\\nThe Arab world has been historically conservative in social and moral issues due to the strong influence of Islam. All Arab countries have strong censorship laws against illicit and immoral content.\\nArab States of the Persian Gulf\\n\\nSaudi Arabia is the home of Islam and its two holy shrines, the king\\'s (Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud) title is \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\". Saudi Arabia\\'s role in the Islamic world enforces it to adhere to strict interpretation of Islam, of which it follows the most strict madhab of Islamic jurisprudence imam Hanbal.\\n\\nIndia\\nHindu social conservatism\\n\\nHindu social conservatism in India in the twenty first century has developed into an influential movement. Represented in the political arena by the right-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party and far-right wing Shiv Sena. Hindu social conservatism, also known as the Hindutva movement, is spearheaded by the voluntary non-governmental organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The core philosophy of this ideology is nativism and sees Hinduism as a national identity rather than a religious one. Due to an inclination towards nativism, much of its platform is based on the belief that Islamic and Christian denominations in India are the result of occupations, and therefore these groups should not receive concessions from the state.In terms of political positions, Hindu social conservatives in India seek to institutionalise a Uniform Civil Code (which is also a directive under Article 44 of the Constitution of India) for members of all religions, over the current scheme of different personal laws for different religions. For instance, polygamy is legal for Muslims in India but not Hindus.\\nMuslim social conservatism\\n\\nThere are several socially conservative Muslim organisations in India, ranging from groups such as the Indian Union Muslim League which aim to promote the preservation of Indian Muslim culture as a part of the nation\\'s identity and history, to radical organisations such as the Mujahadeen and Lakshar-E-Taiba which aim to eradicate all other religions in South Asia.\\n\\nCanada\\nIn Canada, social conservatism, though widespread, is not as prominent in the public sphere as in the United States. It is prevalent in all areas of the country but is seen as being more prominent in rural areas. It is also a significant influence on the ideological and political culture of the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia as they were largely settled by American immigrants in the 19th century. \\nCompared to social conservatism in the United States, social conservatism has not been as influential in Canada. The main reason is that the neoliberal or neoconservative style of politics as promoted by leaders such as former Liberal Party of Canada Prime Minister Paul Martin and Former Conservative Party of Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper have focused on economic conservatism, with little or no emphasis on moral or social conservatism. Without a specific, large political party behind them, social conservatives have divided their votes and can be found in all political parties.Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called \"Red Tories\" for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada. Despite the Reform Party being dominated by social conservatives, leader Preston Manning, seeking greater national support for the party, was reluctant for the party to wholly embrace socially conservative values. This led to his deposition as leader of the party (now called Canadian Alliance) in favor of social conservative Stockwell Day. The party\\'s successor, the Conservative Party of Canada, despite having a number of socially conservative members and cabinet ministers, has chosen so far not to focus on socially conservative issues in its platform. This was most recently exemplified on two occasions in 2012 when the current Conservative Party of Canada declared they had no intention to repeal same-sex marriage or abortion laws.\\n\\nSouth Africa\\nSocial conservatism had a huge place in Apartheid South Africa ruled by the National Party. Television in South Africa was not introduced until 1976 out of fear that it would reduce the influence of Afrikaans.  Pornography, gambling and other activities that were deemed undesirable were severely restricted. The majority of businesses were forbidden from doing business on Sunday. Abortion was illegal, except in case of rape, and danger to the mother\\'s life.  Sex education was also restricted.Despite the legalisation of same-sex marriage and polygamy, in modern-day South Africa, the population remains socially conservative on issues such as homosexuality with 80% of the population against homosexuality.\\n\\nUnited States\\nSocial conservatism in the United States is a right-wing political ideology that opposes social progressivism. It is centered on the preservation of what adherents often call \\'traditional\\' or \\'family values\\', though the accepted aims of the movement often vary amongst the organisations it comprises, making it hard to generalise about ideological preferences. There are, however, a number of general principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere, such as opposition to abortion and opposition to same-sex marriage.\\nThe Republican Party is the largest political party with socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform. Other socially conservative parties include the Constitution Party and the Prohibition Party.\\nSocial conservatives are strongest in the South, where they are a mainstream political force with aspirations to translate those ideals using the party platform nationally. In recent decades, the supporters of social conservatism played a major role in the political coalitions of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\\n\\nList of social conservative political parties\\nAlbania\\nRed and Black Alliance\\nConservative Party\\nDemocratic Party of Albania\\nChristian Democrats\\n\\nArgentina\\nChristian Democratic Party\\n\\nAustralia\\nLiberal Party of Australia\\nNational Party of Australia\\nPauline Hanson\\'s One Nation\\nAustralia First Party\\nDemocratic Labour Party\\nChristian Democratic Party\\nAustralian Christians\\nKatter\\'s Australian Party\\nAustralian Conservatives\\n\\nAustria\\nChristian Party of Austria\\nAlliance for the Future of Austria\\nFreedom Party of Austria\\nAustrian People\\'s Party\\n\\nBangladesh\\nJamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh\\n\\nBelgium\\nVlaams Belang\\nVlaams Blok\\nCentre démocrate humaniste\\nChristen-Democratisch en Vlaams\\nChristlich Soziale Partei\\nChristian Social Party\\nCatholic Party\\n\\nBosnia and Herzegovina\\nAlliance of Independent Social Democrats\\n\\nBrazil\\nBrazilian Republican Party\\nPatriota\\nSocial Christian Party\\nSocial Liberal Party\\n\\nCroatia\\nCroatian Christian Democratic Party\\nCroatian Party of Rights\\nCroatian Growth\\n\\nCanada\\nConservative Party of Canada\\nChristian Heritage Party of Canada\\nAlliance of the North\\nPro-Life Alberta Political Association\\nReform Party of Alberta\\nUnited Conservative Party\\n\\nColombia\\nColombian Conservative Party\\n\\nCosta Rica\\nCosta Rican Renewal Party\\nNational Restoration Party\\nChristian Democratic Alliance\\n\\nCzech Republic\\nChristian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People\\'s Party\\nFreedom and Direct Democracy\\nCoalition for Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia\\nNational Democracy\\nCivic Democratic Party (factions)\\n\\nDenmark\\nDanish People\\'s Party\\nChristian Democratic Party\\n\\nFaroe Islands\\nCentre Party\\n\\nFinland\\nChristian Democrats\\nTrue Finns\\n\\nFrance\\nA number of The Republicans members in France as considered socially conservative, including the Christian Democratic Party, LR affiliate\\nMovement for France\\nNational Front\\nNational Republican Movement\\nCoalition pour la Vie et la Famille\\n\\nGermany\\nAlternative für Deutschland\\nDeutsche Zentrumspartei (ZENTRUM) (German Centre Party)\\nBündnis C – Christen für Deutschland (\"Alliance C – Christians for Germany\")\\nFamilien-Partei Deutschlands (Family Party of Germany)\\nGerman Social Union\\nThe Republicans\\nChristian Social Union in Bavaria\\nChristian Democratic Union\\n\\nGreece\\nNew Democracy\\nPopular Orthodox Rally\\nIndependent Greeks\\nGolden Dawn\\n\\nHungary\\nJobbik\\nHungarian Justice and Life Party\\nFidesz\\nChristian Democratic People\\'s Party (Hungary)\\nThe Homeland Not For Sale Movement Party\\n\\nIceland\\nPeople\\'s Party\\nIcelandic National Front\\n\\nIndia\\nBharatiya Janata Party\\nShiv Sena\\n\\nIndonesia\\nPartai Demokrat\\n\\nIran\\nCombatant Clergy Association\\nIslamic Society of Engineers\\n\\nIreland\\nCatholic Democrats (Ireland)\\nChristian Solidarity Party\\nFamily Solidarity\\nNational Party\\nRenua Ireland\\n\\nNorthern Ireland\\nDemocratic Unionist Party\\nTraditional Unionist Voice\\nUlster Unionist Party\\n\\nIsrael\\nShas\\nUnited Torah Judaism\\nManhigut Yehudit\\nThe Jewish Home -
