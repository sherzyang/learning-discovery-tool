    "sample = \"On one level, this is a business dispute that highlights tensions in the music industry (both intractably ancient and very current). When Swift signed her six-album deal that furnished Big Machine with rights to her masters, she was partaking in a classic arrangement for new artists: handing over future control of music in exchange for start-up promotional, recording, and distribution help. As she’s risen to megastardom, she’s chafed at that arrangement the same way that many successful musicians have chafed at not having ownership of their work. Prince, who famously protested Warner Bros. Records in 1993 by writing the word slave on his cheek, struck a deal for his own back catalog at great cost in 2014. Paul McCartney preached for years about the importance of artists owning music—and one person he preached to, Michael Jackson, ended up buying the rights to the Beatles’ catalog from under him. West himself recently filed suit to gain control of his own masters.\""
